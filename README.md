# Moov Slack Code of Conduct
The code of conduct for participating in the Moov slack community 
===========================

Welcome!
--------

The Moov slack community exists to support the development of open source implementations of financial protocols. Spearheaded by the Moov Financial organization and supported by developers in companies around the world, the Moov project is focused on open collaboration. Having already seen billions of transactions run through them, the Moov open source libraries are a battle tested resource for building next generation financial products. 

The current admins are:
* @WadeArnold
* @alrightjones

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately or risk expulsion from this slack.

Guiding Principal:
--------------------
**Give First** 
Popularized by [Brad Feld](https://twitter.com/bfeld) in his book [Startup communities](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1531886035), "Give First" means giving value without the expectation of return. To learn more about the philosiphy listen to [Brad's explanation](https://www.techstars.com/the-line/podcasts/what-is-give-first).


Sales and Marketing:
-----------------

**Any attempts to use this community as a sales channel are strictly prohibited**. This is especially true when it comes to DM's. In the rare instance that someone publicly asks for reccomendations for products or services it is acceptable to reply with a link to you product. The Moov Financial, Inc. organization does not use this community as a sales channel and we hold our sales people to these same standards. Please focus your time and effort in this community on adding value without the expectation of return in other words, Give First. 

Logs and Records:
-----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention:
------------------

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of Moov. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

Off Topic Discussion:
------------------

The Moov community reserves the right to remove any discussion that does not directly pertain to the financial industry, fintech, or banking more broadly. This is a professional community focused on solving low level financial technical problems. While we do maintian small off topic channels like #food, #healthyliving, and #pets the topics discussed in these channels should remain relevant to their respective topics. If you're found to be consistently starting off topic discussions in the community you will be asked to leave. 


Harassment:
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting:
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences:
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
